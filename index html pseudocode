I want a single page website
sectioned off like wptk.org
first section about me
second section faq or smth? list of services? testimonials? in faq, talk about location. I'm located in ann arbor and can do in person or remote.
third section contact form
second and third sections open and closeable maybe?
where can I put in pictures to make this look friendly?
within nav, click to scroll to testimonials or w/e and open the drawer

script like olu/bear's to make a map of where cursor was moved, except for everyone not just robots?


note:
olu.online (and by extension bearblog.dev)
wptk.org

questions for others:
why isn't the form using the overall font family?
